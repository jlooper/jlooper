## Projects of Note:

I've published a textbook for kids in grades 6-8, published by Wiley, entitled **Computer Science for Kids**. It is alighted to CSTA standards and has a fun, game-driven storyline with bespoke print illustrations. Follow this project [here](https://github.com/cs4kids) and consider purchasing the book for the cool middle-schooler in your life!

I also published **The Illustrated AWS Cloud**, a visually-guided story-led approach to learning the fundamentals of Cloud Computing using AWS. Check out its web site [here](https://illustratedaws.cloud). All the author's proceeds from this book will go to [Code To Inspire](https://codetoinspire.org), a program helping women in Afghanistan learn to code.

Enjoy [free Machine Learning zines](https://zines.jenlooper.com)!

I founded Front-End Foxes, Inc., an international nonprofit, in 2018. Find our awesome [workshops](https://frontendfoxes.github.io/curriculum/) and [community recipe book](https://frontendfoxes.github.io/kitchen-sune/).

Check out the Digital Humanities Toolkit, currently under development [here](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Toolkit).

## Some fun facts:

✨ I was Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS before the company deprioritized grass-roots student outreach. When at AWS, I founded AWS Cloud Clubs, which great to 52K students globally in 32 countries. I'm very proud of what I was able to achieve despite significant budgetary and staffing headwinds.

✨ I also worked at Microsoft for several years, co-leading the Academic Team in DevRel among other activities. I've also worked in nonprofits, small startups, and medium sized companies.

✨ I've written some amazing curricula while at my time at Microsoft that ranks very high on GitHub and has millions of views. It's not in the shape I left it, but if you'd like to see it as I originally designed it, with images intact, a fork is [here](https://github.com/jlooper/Web-Dev-For-Beginners). This is how this curriculum was designed and should look. I also kept copies of the ML, AI, IoT and Data Science curricula which you can find here as well.

✨ I teach occasionally at Boston University's Metropolitan School in the CS department.

✨ I have over 23 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating cross-platform mobile and web apps.

✨ I enjoy using machine learning solutions within a mobile and web context (applied ML).

✨ Mostly these days I build with Vue.js and Astro.

✨ I live in Wellesley, Massachusetts (USA) with my husband and am an empty nester with two adult daughters
